### Info
In this lab, we'll inject the shellcode we created in lab3 to the vulnerable simple_login program in lab1 and trigger its execution.<br/><br/>
**Environment**: Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS<br>
**Keywords**: buffer, overflow, shellcode, exploit, nop, nopsled.

### Implementation
There are two prerequisites to make it work
- ASLR must be disabled. ASLR is a security technique that makes it hard to predict target addresses for exploits.Basically, in every run
of an executable, OS generates different address layouts for stack, and shared libraries. You'll see later in lab why we need to disable it.
It's disabled as the following:
`echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`. 
- Stack must be executable as also shown in lab4.
