### Info
In this lab, we'll try to run our shellcode by injecting it to the shellcode harness program.<br/><br/>
**Environment**: Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS<br/>
**Keywords**: shellcode, executable stack

### Implementation
#### Intro
The so called shellcode harness problem will take byte list as an argument and execute the bytes.
It simply replaces the return address of main stack frame with the address of argv[1] (which is the address of shellcode)
```
int main(int argc, char **argv) 
{
    int *ret;
    ret = (int *)&ret + 2;
    (*ret) = (int)argv[1];
}
```
However OS pushes the program arguments to stack of the process, and unless instructed explicitly, gcc marks the stack as not executable.
That's if $eip points to a location in stack, the program will get a segmentation.
With `-z execstack` switch, we tell gcc to mark stack as executable.

#### Test
Notice how we pass the content of hello_shellcode using "Command substitution". This is a feature of the shell that
allows you to execute a command and have the output of that command replace (substitute) the text of the command.
```
uzi@pwnpatrol:$ ./shellcode_harness `cat ../lab3_converting_lab2_to_shellcode/hello_shellcode`
Owned!!!Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```
